# Welcome to my website!

This website is meant to emulate terminal-like behavior as a website. All of the content is represented as files and directories on a computer. Navigation is handled with `unix-style` commands. `help` will offer information on what commands are available and how they function.

## Planned Features
- Displaying images
- Light/dark mode
- Simple shell scripts
- Text editing
- More advanced command parsing
- Handling `..` and `.` in paths

# Thank you for taking the time to browse!
