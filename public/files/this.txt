I wrote this website as an experiment to see just how far I could take a concept. I wanted to build a website that mimicked a unix-termina and serve as my personal portfolio. Everything is written from scratch in pure HTML, CSS, and Javascript. The only notable exception is rendering Mardown text as HTML.
Things are far from perfect and it is still a work in progress, but improvements will come as soon and often as I am able to dream them up.
Please enjoy my cumbersome, eclectic, and largely impractical website.
