I’ve always been driven by curiosity — as a kid, I’d take apart my toys and gadgets just to see how they worked. I’d inevitably panic when I couldn’t get them back together, but after enough tinkering and perseverance, I’d figure it out. That instinct to break things down, understand them deeply, and put them back together more effectively has stuck with me throughout my career as a software engineer.

What draws me in most is chasing problems that make you stop and really think — the ones where technical rigor meets creativity and innovation. I love the challenge of crafting solutions that are both elegant and efficient, where you’re not just optimizing for speed, but also for clarity and maintainability. For me, it’s about finding that balance between precision and imagination, and always looking for ways to push what’s possible.

But enough about my work. Outside of engineering, I’m remarkably low-tech. I find myself drawn to things that require a slower, more deliberate pace — cooking meals from scratch, shooting on film cameras, listening to records on vinyl. There’s something deeply satisfying about engaging fully with a process, understanding the tools at hand, and embracing the imperfections that come with doing things manually. It’s that same curiosity and willingness to tinker that got me into engineering in the first place.

I like the idea that not everything needs to be optimized or automated. Sometimes, the joy is in the effort itself — in slowing down, being present, and appreciating the small details that get lost when you rush to the finish line. That balance between the fast-paced world of engineering and the mindful, tactile experience of my hobbies helps me stay grounded and connected to the things that really matter.
